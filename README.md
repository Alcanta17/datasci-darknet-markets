# datasci-darknet-markets
Example Python code for preprocessing an archive of DarkNet html pages.

### About
The example Python code was used to extract product listing information 
from raw HTML pages sourced from black market websites. The code was applied
across tens of thousands of separate html pages, and the extracted information 
saved to flat .csv files (for subsequent loading into a MySQL database). 

### Further details
