# datasci-darknet-markets
Example Python code for preprocessing an archive of DarkNet html pages.

### About
The example Python code was used to extract product listing information 
from raw HTML pages sourced from black market websites. The code was applied
across thousands of separate pages, and the extracted information saved to 
.csv (for subsequent loading in a MySQL database).
